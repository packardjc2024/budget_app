This application is a budget app using Flask that uses ORM type models that were made by me.

I created a budget and Expense class as well as Budget and Expense models that handle all of the
table methods. I also wrote all of the sql commands and used mysql.connector. This was to practice
and demonstrate my understanding of sql compared to the Django version that using the built in
ORM models systems.
